The Goal of this Project is to:
  1. Import the Training and testing Datasets
  2. Classification of Training Dataset using Decision Tree Classifier
  3. Display the feature of testing Data plotted.
  4. Predict the Value of the Image or feature with Classification done for Training Data.
  5. Show the Highest Accuracy of the Features with respect to trained sets.
Working process and work Done till now:
  1.Import the Training and Testing Datasets and convert the Datasets into matrix form.
  Decision Tree:
    In this project, i used Decision Tree Classifier that classifies the Training Data with it's labels. The labels defines the features         with it's Label ID present in 1st Column of Dataset. Then, the Testing Data is taken and labels is specified as Actual Labels.
    The main aim in Decision Tree Classifier is to predict the most accurated value (Decision making) from the Trained set when we give a       testing Feature.
  2. After the Classification and fitting the labels with feature of trained data using DecisionTreeClassifier(), the testing feature is          taken to predict the value.
  3. Then, the Testing Image is selected as feature and shown in plot (28,28).
  4. Taken the feature with it's label ID, predicted with the Trained set that is Classified to get more accurated value as result for            Feature.
  5. When result is displayed, it will check the Accuracy with the Trained Classification to get more Accuracy.
 
Note: Due to the size of training set more than 25MB, can't upload the Trained set file. Mail me to get trained set :

Note: Mapping.csv used to get the Ascii value mapped with the number when the number shown in output of feature ( Not included in Progream).
